,Advice-Sequential steps,Students think making the steps sequentially instead of showing same steps for both terminal and IDE will be helpful,"I'd say like group sequential steps on the same page, because there were some times where I was on one step. "

,Overall Experience-Recursive tasks difficult,Students think the recursive tasks were difficult for them,"if the code itself is pretty long, then it will become difficult. And some recursion code requires you to keep track of everything. Because I don't have a scratch paper."
